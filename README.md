Hello! My name is Hendrik van Antwerpen and I am an engineer at GitHub.
I work with my colleagues to provide great semantic code services to all GitHub users.

In case you were wondering, my avatar was created by a slightly more talented artist than myself, Joan Miro, and hangs over my physical desk as well!
